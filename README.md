# OpenGL_Physics
This program uses collision detection to simulate the physics of two bouncing balls. For me, this was a very basic introduction to writing shaders for OpenGL.

Simply run the executable. Be sure it is in the same directory as the res folder, which contains the shaders. Changing the initial positions and velocities in Balls.cpp starting on line 229 will create different results.
